4. As it turns out, there are few theoretical guarantees that a neural
network with a given architecture will actually find a good solution
on a given dataset when trained using the standard training
techniques well use in this book. In Chapter 4 well cover the
most important training tricks that generally increase the
probability that a neural network will find a good solution, and,
wherever possible, give some mathematical intuition as to why
they work.
