7. Finally, in Chapter 7, Ill show how everything we did from scratch
in Chapters 16 can be implemented using the high-performance,
open source neural network library PyTorch. Learning a
framework like this is essential for progressing your learning about
neural networks; but diving in and learning a framework without
first having a solid understanding of how and why neural networks
work would severely limit your learning in the long term. The goal
of the progression of chapters in this book is to give you the power
to write extremely high-performance neural networks (by teaching
you PyTorch) while still setting you up for long-term learning and
success (by teaching you the fundamentals before you learn
PyTorch). Well conclude with a quick illustration of how neural
networks can be used for unsupervised learning.
