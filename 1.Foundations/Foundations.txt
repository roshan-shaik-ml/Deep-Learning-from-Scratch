1. In Chapter 1 Ill show how mathematical functions can be
represented as a series of operations linked together to form a
computational graph, and show how this representation lets us
compute the derivatives of these functions outputs with respect to
their inputs using the chain rule from calculus. At the end of this
chapter, Ill introduce a very important operation, the matrix
multiplication, and show how it can fit into a mathematical
function represented in this way while still allowing us to compute
the derivatives well end up needing for deep learning.
