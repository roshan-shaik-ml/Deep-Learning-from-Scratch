5. In Chapter 5 I cover the fundamental ideas behind convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), a kind of neural network architecture
specialized for understanding images. There are many explanations
of CNNs out there, so Ill focus on explaining the absolute
essentials of CNNs and how they differ from regular neural
networks: specifically, how CNNs result in each layer of neurons
being organized into feature maps, and how two of these layers
(each made up of multiple feature maps) are connected together via
convolutional filters. In addition, just as we coded the regular
layers in a neural network from scratch, well code convolutional
layers from scratch to reinforce our understanding of how they
work
