2. In Chapter 2 well directly use the building blocks we created in
Chapter 1 to build and train models to solve a real-world problem:
specifically, well use them to build both linear regression and
neural network models to predict housing prices on a real-world
dataset. Ill show that the neural network performs better than the
linear regression and try to give some intuition for why. The first
principles approach to building the models in this chapter should
give you a very good idea of how neural networks work, but will
also show the limited capability of the step-by-step, purely firstprinciples-based approach to defining deep learning models; this
will motivate Chapter 3.
